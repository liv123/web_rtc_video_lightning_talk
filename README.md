<h2> WebRTC from http://www.webrtc.org/ <h2>



WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose. 

Our mission: To enable rich, high quality, RTC applications to be developed  for the browser, mobile platforms, and IoT devices, and allow them all to communicate via a common set of protocols.

The WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera, amongst others. This page is maintained by the Google Chrome team.

VideoEngine

VideoEngine is a framework video media chain for video, from camera to the network, and from network to the screen.


Video codec from the WebM Project. Well suited for RTC as it is designed for low latency.

Video Jitter Buffer

Dynamic Jitter Buffer for video. Helps conceal the effects of jitter and packet loss on overall video quality.
Image enhancements

For example, removes video noise from the image capture by the webcam.
